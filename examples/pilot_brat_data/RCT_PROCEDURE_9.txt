Delayed Cord Clamping versus Early Cord Clamping in Elective Cesarean Section: A Randomized Controlled Trial
BACKGROUND: Delaying cord clamping is recommended in order to assure placental transfusion. However, the evidence on cord management in elective cesarean section (CS) is limited. OBJECTIVE: To compare delayed cord clamping (DCC) with early cord clamping (ECC) with regard to postnatal adaptation in neonates born through elective CS. METHODS: All neonates born ≥39 weeks' gestation born through elective CS were assigned to either the DCC or the ECC arm at a 1:1 ratio according to a computer-generated, randomized sequence. The primary outcome was the hematocrit at day 2 of life. Secondary outcomes included: preductal oxygen saturation and heart rate during the first 10 min of life; transcutaneous bilirubin at day 3; and neonatal blood pressures in the first 3 days of life. Additional outcomes included: time to first spontaneous breath; temperature at admission to normal nursery; weight at discharge; and maternal blood losses. RESULTS: Eighty neonates were randomized to the DCC (n = 40) or the ECC (n = 40) arm. The hematocrit at day 2 was significantly higher in the DCC arm than in the ECC arm (mean difference: 6%; 95% CI 3-8; p < 0.0001). The secondary outcome measures were not statistically different between the two arms. No infants needed phototherapy for hyperbilirubinemia during their hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS: Delaying cord clamping beyond 60 s increases the hematocrit at day 2 in neonates born through elective CS, without affecting maternal blood losses. Our findings suggest that DCC should be recommended in elective CS, but further studies are warranted to assess long-term outcomes.
