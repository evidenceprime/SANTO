Efficacy and survival of golimumab with and without methotrexate in patients with psoriatic arthritis: A retrospective study from daily clinical practice
Golimumab is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody targeted against tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Golimumab is effective in the management of patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA). The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy and survival of golimumab monotherapy versus co-administration with methotrexate (MTX) in patients with PsA in the clinical practice. This retrospective observational trial included patients with PsA. Efficacy was assessed by disease activity scores - DAS28, BASDAI, physician global assessment of disease (PGA) and CRP. Golimumab survival rate was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier analysis and univariate and multivariate Cox regression models. Forty-one patients with PsA were recruited; 26 patients were treated with golimumab, whereas 15 patients received combination therapy with MTX. The treatment resulted in significantly improved clinical measures of disease activity in comparison with baseline, including DAS28 CRP (4.1 vs 2.6, p ≤ 0.0001) and BASDAI (5.6 vs 3.8, p ≤ 0.001). Overall, 29 (71%) patients continued golimumab treatment (18 patients on monotherapy and 11 on combination therapy). The difference in the duration of golimumab survival between the combination therapy and monotherapy groups was not statistically significant (12.5 vs 12 months, p = 0.2). Similar efficacy profiles and survival rates were documented in patients with PsA regardless of the co-administration of methotrexate.
