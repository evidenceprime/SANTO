Early ileostomy closure in patients with rectal cancer. Primary results of the randomized controlled multicenter trial
AIM: To evaluate safety of early closure of ileostomy in patients with rectal cancer after primary surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The trial included patients from several medical centers without signs of anastomotic leakage. CT-proctography or rectoscopy were performed in 8 days after primary surgery to confirm integrity of the anastomoses. Exclusion criteria were factors affecting normal tissue regeneration (diabetes mellitus, steroid drugs prescription, etc.). Patients with intact anastomoses and no exclusion criteria were randomized into 2 groups: group 1 (n=31) with early closure of ileostomy (in 8-13 days after surgery) and group 2 (n=34) with delayed closure (after 12 weeks). All data were analyzed. RESULTS: Postoperative morbidity was similar in both groups (6.45% vs. 5.88%, p=0.08). However, less duration of reconstructive surgery was noted in group 1 (50 (27-126) min vs. 71 min (31-134). This value was 1.42 times less in the main group (95% CI 1.30-1.52; p=0.02). CONCLUSION: Early closure of ileostomy in patients after surgery for rectal cancer is feasible and does not result increased postoperative morbidity. This approach may be considered as an alternative to delayed closure. However, further researches devoted to analysis of ileostomy-associated complications and quality of life are necessary.
