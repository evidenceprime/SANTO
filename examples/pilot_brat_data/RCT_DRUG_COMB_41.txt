A Randomized, Double-blinded, Controlled, Multicentre Phase III Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Telmisartan /Amlodipine/Hydrochlorothiazide Compared to Telmisartan/Hydrochlorothiazide in Patients with Essential Hypertension
OBJECTIVE: Triple drug combination has shown to be effective in controlling blood pressure (BP) with low rates of drug-related side effects. The present study was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of a triple pill of telmisartan/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) with a dual combination of telmisartan/HCTZ in treating hypertensive patients who did not respond to monotherapies. METHODS: A total of 512 patients were randomized to receive either low-dose triple pill or the dual combination therapy. The primary endpoint was BP normalization after 8 weeks. The secondary endpoints were BP normalization at 4 weeks, changes in BP from baseline to Week 8, comparison of BP normalization between treatment groups, and difference in BP responder rates. The analysis was conducted on the intent-to-treat (ITT), modified intent-to-treat (mITT) and per protocol (PP) population. RESULTS: Statistically significant difference was noted between triple pill and telmi+HCTZ in the normalization of BP at Week 8 in the mITT (p=0.041) and PP (p=0. 038) populations. Also, a statistically significant improvement was observed in BP normalization in triple pill group compared with telmi+HCTZ group in ITT (p=0.022) and mITT (p=0.015) populations after 4 weeks. At Week 8, a significant reduction in BP was seen compared to the baseline in both the treatment groups. There was no statistically significant difference between the two treatment groups in BP normalization. Diastolic BP responder rates were significantly better for triple pill group in PP population (p=0.046). CONCLUSIONS: The triple pill was found to be effective in achieving early normalization of BP in hypertensive patients who did not respond to monotherapies.
