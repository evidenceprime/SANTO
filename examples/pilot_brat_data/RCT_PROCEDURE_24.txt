Effect of yoga on FEV1, 6-minute walk distance (6-MWD) and quality of life in patients with COPD group B
INTRODUCTION: Yoga is used in the treatment of various diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. However, no studies have assessed the effect of yoga on COPD patients in Indonesia. The difference between this study and similar studies completed in other countries lies in the type of yoga exercises completed, the method in which they were completed, and in certain, unique demographic characteristics. This study aims to analyze the effect of yoga on FEV1, 6-minute walk distance, and quality of life in patients with COPD group B in Indonesia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This article reflects research done in the form of an experimental study using arandomized controlled trial with pre and post-test control group design. The samples were divided into 2 groups: the treatment group (yoga practice for 1 hour, 2 times aweek for 12 weeks) and the control group (untreated with yoga, given lung rehabilitation brochure). Assessment of the effect of yoga exercises on lung function parameters (FEV1), 6-minute walk distance and quality of life were used using SGRQ questionnaires in COPD group B. RESULTS: 33 COPD patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. 30 patients completed the study. Pre and post yoga results were evalu-ated in the treatment group versus the control group and then further assessed using statistical tests. There was asignificant in-crease in FEV1, 6-MWD and quality of life using aSGRQ questionnaire after 12 weeks of yoga (p < 0.05) as well as aasignificant change in FEV1, 6-MWD and quality of life in the treatment group (p < 0.05) when compared with the control group (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Yoga affects FEV1, 6-MWD, and quality of life in patients with Group B COPD.
