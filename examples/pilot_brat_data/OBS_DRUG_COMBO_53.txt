Modified Folfox6 as Adjuvant Chemotherapy in Vietnamese Patients With Colorectal Cancer
Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer and the second leading cause of death from cancer worldwide. In Vietnam, the disease is the fifth leading cancer (8.9%), with 14 733 new cases in 2018. In recent years, the mFolfox6 regimen has been indicated commonly as the adjuvant chemotherapy after curative resection for patients with colorectal cancer. However, the efficacy of the regimen in Vietnamese patients has not been assessed and reported. In this retrospective study, we reviewed medical records of 83 patients with stage II or stage III colorectal cancer who received mFOLFOX6 regimen in order to investigate simultaneously survival and safety of this chemotherapy regimen. Three-year overall and disease-free survival were 84.3% and 79.5%, respectively. Our data revealed that postoperative Carcinoma Embryonic Antigen (CEA) level was a significant prognostic factor for survival, with hazard ratio of 3.83 and 3.67, respectively (P < .05), for overall survival and disease-free survival in the elevated CEA level group when compared to the normal CEA level group. The regimen also demonstrated to be well tolerated and can be used in routine practice as an adjuvant chemotherapy.
