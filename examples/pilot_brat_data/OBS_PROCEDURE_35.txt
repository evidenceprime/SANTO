Medium-long-term mortality and change in functional status in elderly patients with pacemaker
BACKGROUND: Nowadays, 49% of patients with pacemakers are older than 80 years old. Nevertheless, mortality and change in functional status after pacemaker implantation are not well documented in elderly patients. OBJECTIVE: We designed a prospective study to analyze the cardiovascular mortality and change in functional status of elderly patients, medium-long term after pacemaker implantation. METHODS: An observational study including pacemaker implants in individual older than 70 years old in a single-center university hospital between 2012 and 2014. Analysis testing for an association between pacemaker system, medium-long-term mortality, and functional status after implantation was undertaken. RESULTS: About 60% of patients were older than 80 years old. The third-degree atrioventricular blockage (44.3%) and slow ventricular response atrial fibrillation (16.7%) were the most frequent electrocardiogram abnormalities, while bicameral DDD was the sort of pacing our department used the most (38.6%) (VVI in octogenarian patients, 38.7%). Long-term mortality was significantly higher in ventricular devices, especially in octogenarian patients (p = 0.001). Single-chamber VVI pacing acted as independent predictors of all-cause mortality in these individuals (p = 0.001). We found no significant improvement in Barthel Index and functional status in this subgroup of patients, 3 years after pacing. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term mortality in individuals older than 80 years old with pacemaker implantation was significantly higher comparing with general population, especially in ventricular devices. No significant improvement in functional status was detected in this subgroup of patients.
