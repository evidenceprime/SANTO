Extended-release vinpocetine: a possible adjuvant treatment for focal onset epileptic seizures
BACKGROUND: Extended-release vinpocetine is effective to control focal onset epileptic seizures with a low rate of adverse events. A clinical study was performed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of vinpocetine as an adjuvant treatment in patients with this condition. METHODS: A double-blind clinical study of parallel groups was conducted, in which 87 patients with a diagnosis of focal epilepsy treated with one to three antiepileptic drugs were recruited. Patients were randomized to receive vinpocetine (n = 41) or placebo (n = 46) adjuvant to their treatment. Patients entered the baseline phase (4 weeks), the titration phase (4 weeks) and the evaluation phase (8 weeks), maintaining stable doses of vinpocetine and their respective antiepileptic drug treatment. RESULTS: Vinpocetine was more effective than placebo in reducing seizures at the end of the evaluation phase (p < 0.0001). Sixty-nine percent of the vinpocetine-treated patients had a 50% reduction in seizures compared to 13% of placebo-treated patients. No significant differences in the presence of adverse effects in patients treated with vinpocetine compared to those treated with placebo were observed. The most frequent adverse events observed with vinpocetine were headache (7.9%) and diplopia (5.2%). CONCLUSIONS: As an adjuvant treatment, vinpocetine (2 mg/kg/day) effectively reduced the frequency of epileptic seizures and proved to be well tolerated. Vinpocetine has a wide safety profile and well-known adverse events, which are transient and with no sequelae.
